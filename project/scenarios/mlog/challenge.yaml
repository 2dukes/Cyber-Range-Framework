  **NOTE:** this challenge uses a heavy PoW because unfortunately OpenAI is
  expensive. Please use your own OpenAI API key to test; then once you are
  confident, try against the remote server.

  **Quickstart:** install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation),
  then run `poetry install` and `OPENAI_KEY=<your key here> poetry run mlog`.
