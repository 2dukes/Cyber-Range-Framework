\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Agradecimentos}

The first explicit acknowledgement goes to my two supervisors, Professors Rolando Martins and Carlos Novo, who supported me unconditionally even when the project's path seemed undefined, providing me tips and feedback throughout the project. And thank you for the words of will and courage on every meeting we had. They really helped me improve my self-esteem. Lastly, I would like to thank Professor Ricardo Morla, for being the person initially responsible for the project's subject.  


The other acknowledgement is for everyone that was part of my journey over the past five years and that explicitly or implicitly helped me stay strong in this period of my life. To all of them, a huge thank you because in one way or another, they helped me make the person I am today. Names are not mentioned because I did not want to risk leaving anyone out. To my family, girlfriend and friends, thank you for showing me what patience and love means.
