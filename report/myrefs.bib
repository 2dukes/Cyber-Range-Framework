abstract = {The first line of defense against cyber threats and cyber crimes is to be aware and get ready, e.g., through cyber security training. Training can have two forms, the first is directed towards security professionals and aims at improving understanding of the latest threats and increasing skill levels in defending and mitigating against them. The second form of training, which used to attract less attention, aims at increasing cyber security awareness among non-security professionals and the general public. Conducting such training programs requires dedicated testbeds and infrastructures that help realizing and executing the training scenarios and provide a playground for the trainees. A cyber range is an environment that aims at providing such testbeds. The purpose of this paper is to study the concept of a cyber range, and provide a systematic literature review that covers unclassified cyber ranges and security testbeds. In this study we develop a taxonomy for cyber range systems and evaluate the current literature focusing on architecture and scenarios, but including also capabilities, roles, tools and evaluation criteria. The results of this study can be used as a baseline for future initiatives towards the development and evaluation of cyber ranges in accordance with existing best practices and lessons learned from contemporary research and developments.}

However, creating an environment that contains all the necessary features and settings, such as virtual machines, network topology and security-related content, is not an easy task, especially for a large number of participants. Therefore, we propose CyRIS (Cyber Range Instantiation System) as a solution towards this problem. CyRIS provides a mechanism to automatically prepare and manage cyber ranges for cybersecurity education and training based on specifications defined by the instructors. In this paper, we first describe the design and implementation of CyRIS, as well as its utilization. We then present an evaluation of CyRIS in terms of feature coverage compared to the Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment of the U.S National Institute of Standards and Technology, and in terms of functionality compared to other similar tools. We also discuss the execution performance of CyRIS for several representative scenarios.},

Only such practical activities can ensure that trainees will acquire the actual skills necessary to promptly deal with security incidents in real-life situations. However, current programs rely significantly on the manual setup and configuration of the learning and/or training environments used, which is a tedious, inefficient and error-prone approach. In this paper, we present an integrated cybersecurity training framework, named CyTrONE, that we designed and implemented to address such shortcomings by automating the training content generation and environment setup tasks. After we discuss the architecture and implementation of the framework, we demonstrate the framework effectiveness by evaluating it from both functionality and performance perspectives. Our results show that CyTrONE is well-suited for actual training activities in terms of features, usability and execution performance.}

abstract = {Context: Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the practice to automatically configure system dependencies and to provision local and remote instances. Practitioners consider IaC as a fundamental pillar to implement DevOps practices, which helps them to rapidly deliver software and services to end-users. Information technology (IT) organizations, such as GitHub, Mozilla, Facebook, Google and Netflix have adopted IaC. A systematic mapping study on existing IaC research can help researchers to identify potential research areas related to IaC, for example defects and security flaws that may occur in IaC scripts. Objective: The objective of this paper is to help researchers identify research areas related to infrastructure as code (IaC) by conducting a systematic mapping study of IaC-related research. Method: We conduct our research study by searching five scholar databases. We collect a set of 31,498 publications by using seven search strings. By systematically applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, which includes removing duplicates and removing non-English and non peer-reviewed publications, we identify 32 publications related to IaC. We identify topics addressed in these publications by applying qualitative analysis. Results: We identify four topics studied in IaC-related publications: (i) framework/tool for infrastructure as code; (ii) adoption of infrastructure as code; (iii) empirical study related to infrastructure as code; and (iv) testing in infrastructure as code. According to our analysis, 50.0% of the studied 32 publications propose a framework or tool to implement the practice of IaC or extend the functionality of an existing IaC tool. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that framework or tools is a well-studied topic in IaC research. As defects and security flaws can have serious consequences for the deployment and development environments in DevOps, we observe the need for research studies that will study defects and security flaws for IaC.}

abstract="Cybersecurity tools are increasingly automated with artificial intelligent (AI) capabilities to match the exponential scale of attacks, compensate for the relatively slower rate of training new cybersecurity talents, and improve of the accuracy and performance of both tools and users. However, the safe and appropriate usage of autonomous cyber attack tools--especially at the development stages for these cyber attack tools -- is still largely an unaddressed gap. Our survey of current literature and tools showed that most of the existing cyber range designs are mostly using manual tools and have not considered augmenting automated tools or the potential security issues caused by the tools. In other words, there is still room for a novel cyber range design which allow security researchers to safely deploy autonomous tools and perform automated tool testing if needed. In this paper, we introduce Pandora, a safe testing environment which allows security researchers and cyber range users to perform experiments on automated cyber attack tools that may have strong potential of usage and at the same time, a strong potential for risks. Unlike existing testbeds and cyber ranges which have direct compatibility with enterprise computer systems and the potential for risk propagation across the enterprise network, our test system is intentionally designed to be incompatible with enterprise real-world computing systems to reduce the risk of attack propagation into actual infrastructure. Our design also provides a tool to convert in-development automated cyber attack tools into to executable test binaries for validation and usage realistic enterprise system environments if required. Our experiments tested automated attack tools on our proposed system to validate the usability of our proposed environment. Our experiments also proved the safety of our environment by compatibility testing using simple malicious code.",

abstract = "Cyber ranges are often used to enhance the cybersecurity posture of a company by training relevant skills. These environments are traditionally used to host exercises that simulate cybersecurity scenarios, improve the cybersecurity skills of employees and enhance the security of networks and processes. By using digital twins, it is possible to organise more targeted cyber range trainings to companies operating in the critical infrastructure sector. Especially in this sector it is important to consider the cybersecurity of these environments themselves as they often may handle companyspecific confidential information. This study presents several cybersecurity related threats and challenges that cyber ranges may face during different phases of use. Cyber threats may be exposed to the actual systems that the ranges are meant to protect if these issues are not taken into consideration and mitigated. Malicious attackers may use the information in the cyber ranges to learn the weaknesses in the actual system. We approach the subject by reviewing the relevant literature, which is currently very limited specially when looking at the cybersecurity issues of cyber ranges. We divide the subject into the different phases of cyber range development and use, and also discuss relevant cloud security issues. Finally, we present actions to mitigate the identified cybersecurity threats and issues in cyber ranges when using them for training and awareness activities.",

The consequent exposition to cyber threats demands for suitable methodologies, techniques and tools allowing to adequately handle issues arising in such a complex domain. This paper describes the architecture of SmallWorld, a scalable software platform designed to reproduce realistic scenarios achieved by the immersion of real systems into a software defined virtual environment. SmallWorld enables the assessment, teaching and learning of cybersecurity related aspects in different areas and for various purposes. It exploits innovative and state-of-the-art virtualization and simulation techniques for reproducing in a realistic setting a dynamic environment where large distributed computer systems can be deployed and from where they can interact with real life entities. One of the main features of SmallWorld is the support for designing and building complex scenarios which are dynamic and reactive and where a number of autonomous software agents can be deployed. Agents are able to reproduce the behaviors of human users and/or malicious applications into a SmallWorld scenario making it a more realistic testing environment. The practical use of SmallWorld is shown by means of two realistic case studies.}

These threats majorly exploit misconfiguration vulnerabilities e.g. excessive permissions, disabled logging features and publicly accessible cloud storage buckets. Traditional security tools and mechanisms are unable to effectively and continuously track changes in cloud infrastructure owing to transience and unpredictability of cloud events. Therefore, novel tools that are proactive, agile and continuous are imperative. This article proposes CSBAuditor, a novel cloud security system that continuously monitors cloud infrastructure, to detect malicious activities and unauthorized changes. CSBAuditor leverages two concepts: state transition analysis and reconciler pattern to overcome the aforementioned security issues. Furthermore, security metrics are used to compute severity scores for detected vulnerabilities using a novel scoring system: Cloud Security Scoring System. CSBAuditor has been evaluated using various strategies including security chaos engineering (fault injection) strategies on Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. CSBAuditor effectively detects misconfigurations in real-time with a detection rate of over 98\%. Also, the performance overhead is within acceptable limits.}

This makes the knowledge and understanding of cyber-security in a technologically evolving world difficult. Global IT infrastructure and individuals’ privacy are constantly under threat. One way to tackle this problem is by providing continuous training and self-learning platforms. Cyber-security exercises can provide a necessary platform for training people’s cyber-security skills. However, conducting cyber-security exercises with new and unique scenarios requires comprehensive planning and commitment to the preparation time and resources. In this work, we propose a serious game for the development of cyber-security exercise scenarios. The game provides a platform to model simulated cyber-security exercise scenarios, transforming them into an emulated cyber-security exercise environment using domain-specific language (DSL) and infrastructure orchestration. In this game, players can play as cyber attackers or defenders in a multiplayer environment to make operational cyber-security decisions in real-time. The decisions are evaluated for the development of operational cyber-attack and defense strategies.}

abstract = {Cyber Ranges are complex infrastructures hosting high quality exercises that simulate cybersecurity scenarios of real-world complexity. Building the computing infrastructure is only the first step towards the successful execution of the cyber exercises. The design, verification and deployment of scenarios are costly and error-prone activities. As a matter of fact, a misconfiguration in the scenario can compromise the exercise and the training goals. This makes the design, development, and deployment of live-fire cyber exercises of real-world complexity so expensive that can be afforded only by a limited number of organizations. In this paper we present CRACK, a framework for the (i) design, (ii) model verification, (iii) generation, and (iv) automated testing of cyber scenarios. We introduce the CRACK SDL, a Scenario Definition Language based on TOSCA, an OASIS standard for the specification and orchestration of virtual infrastructures. CRACK SDL allows for the declarative specification of the scenario elements and their interplay, e.g., a vulnerability affecting a system. Through a formal encoding of the properties of an SDL specification, CRACK also supports the automatic verification of a scenario against its training objectives. After a successful verification, the scenario is automatically deployed in the Cyber Range and automatically tested to check the correspondence between the behavior of the deployed system and its specification. The key functionalities offered by CRACK are presented through a simple, yet representative case study. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

abstract = {In any cybersecurity training program, a non-marginal fraction of the activities are usually devoted to ”hands-on” practice, typically in the form of vulnerable scenarios that the trainee must evaluate/penetrate. The manual setup and implementation of such training scenarios is a significant burden on trainers, and takes away valuable time. In order to automate this step and enable reuse of components or even entire scenarios, this paper proposes Nautilus, a Cyber Range with extended capabilities that at the same time provides a training environment and a ”marketplace” platform to share scenarios, pre-implemented vulnerabilities/CVEs, scripts, etc. Nautilus leverages advanced cloud technologies to semi-automate deployment of vulnerable configurations of virtualized networks and systems, provides a graphical interface and a scenario description language, and integrates easy-to-use data/knowledge sharing facilities. In this respect, we believe that Nautilus can foster collaboration among different training teams and programs, and stimulate less skilled trainers, which alone would have perhaps prepared only basic scenarios, to access and reuse more advanced exercises prepared by others. Finally, we preliminary show the effectiveness and ease of use of the Nautilus Cyber Range via the results of a (so far) small-scale usability test conducted among different prospective trainers.},

abstract = {Labtainers are fully provisioned Linux-based computer science lab exercises with an initial emphasis on cybersecurity. Consistent lab execution environments and automated provisioning are provided by Docker containers. With over 50 lab exercises including multi-component networks that all run on a modestly performing laptop computer., Labtainers supports exploratory learning for both local and remote learners. They offer automated assessment of student lab activity and progress as well as individualized lab exercises to discourage sharing solutions. Free and open at: https://nps.edu/web/c3o/labtainers, Labtainers is distributed as a single virtual machine for either VirtualBox or VMWare. On an exercise-specific basis, the framework leverages Docker containers to instantiate one or more networked computers within that single VM. This hands-on workshop covers the basics of creating Labtainer-based labs, whether for security, networking, operating systems, or other computer science classes. The workshop also introduces how this lab framework helps remove three barriers to CS lab exercises: 1) administrative setup and resulting divergent behavior between student environments; 2) sharing of solutions amongst students; 3) assessing student work. Participants should have a computer running either VMWare or VirtualBox, with the Labtainers VM appliance installed.},
